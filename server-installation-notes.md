Learners will find broken images required to take the course without this access. | Manually download the images referenced in the `responses/` folder, upload them to an accessible domain, and replace the images in the `responses/` folder.                                    |
| Learner must be able to reach github.com and outside web                                                                 | No        | Links are provided to resources that live on the outside web.                                                                                    | Without access to resources on the outside web, learners will reach blocked resources. You can change the links to these resources in the `responses/` folder, and in the template repository. |

Look for references to GitHub Pages in the `responses/` folder and remove them.                                         |
