Uh oh, I didn't detect a list! Here are some troubleshooting steps:

1. Check your spelling. We're checking specifically for the tags: `<ul>` or `<ol>`, `<li>`, and `</ul>` or `</ol>`.
2. Check the order of your tags. The opening `<ul>` or `<ol>` tag should appear first, followed `<li>` and `</li>` tags, and then `</ul>` or `</ol>`.
3. Ensure you modified the `index.html` file, and not some other file. 

Let's try again!

### :keyboard: Create a list of your favorite sites

1. Edit the `index.html` file in your master branch by [using this direct link](https://github.com/{{ user.username }}/{{ repo }}/edit/master/index.html) or going to the **Code** tab, clicking on the `index.html` file, clicking the pencil :pencil: to edit the HTML.
1. Inside the body tag, create a list, either ordered or unordered, of your favorite sites on the interwebs.
1. In the _Commit changes_ section, enter a commit message that describes what you've done.
1. Ensure you've selected _Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request_.
1. Give your branch a descriptive name, like `add-links-and-lists`.
1. Click on **Commit changes**.
