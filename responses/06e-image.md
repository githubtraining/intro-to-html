I didn't find the image! Here are some troubleshooting steps:

1. Check your spelling. We're checking specifically for the image, `<img>`, tag with a source attribute: `<img src="`{{ user.avatarUrl }}`">`
3. Make sure you placed the image tag inside the body tags.
4. Ensure you modified the `index.html` file, and not some other file. 

Let's try again!
