Uh oh, I didn't detect `<html>` and `<body>` tags. Here are some troubleshooting steps:

1. Check your spelling. We're checking specifically for the tags: `<html>`, `<body>`, `</body>`, and `</html>`.
2. Check the order of your tags. The opening `<html>` tag should appear first, followed by the opening `<body>` tag, then the content, the closing `<body>` tag, and the closing `<html>` tag.
3. Ensure you modified the `index.html` file, and not some other file. 

Let's try again!

### :keyboard: Activity: Add the `html` and `body` tags to `index.html`

1. Click on **Files Changed** to see the newly added `index.html` file.
1. Click on the :pencil: to edit the file.
1. Before the existing content, add an opening `<html>` tag, and an opeining `<body>` tag.
1. After the existing content, add a closing `</body>` tag, and a closing `</html>` tag.
1. In the _Commit changes_ section, enter a commit message that describes what you've done.
1. Ensure you've selected _Commit directly to the `add-index` branch_.
1. Click on **Commit changes**.
