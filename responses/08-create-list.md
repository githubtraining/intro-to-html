### Ordered and unordered lists

Lists are used all over the internet. They come in two flavors: ordered and unordered.

1. This
2. Is an
3. Ordered list

And...

- This
- Is an
- Unordered list

You can create a list using the `<ol>` tag for ordered lists, and the `<ul>` tag for unordered lists. Then, each item must be wrapped in an `<li>`, or list item, tag. Here's the code that generates the list I showed you above:

```html
<ol>
    <li>This</li>
    <li>Is an</li>
    <li>Ordered list</li>
</ol>
```

And...

```html
<ul>
    <li>This</li>
    <li>Is an</li>
    <li>Unordered list</li>
</ul>
```

For the next exercise, you are going to create a list of your favorite websites. Later, we will add links so you can access those links quickly. For now, focus on creating the individual list items.
