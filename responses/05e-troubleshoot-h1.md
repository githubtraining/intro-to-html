I didn't detect an `<h1>` tag. Here are some troubleshooting steps:

1. Check your spelling. We're checking specifically for the h1 tag: `<h1>`
2. Check the order of your tags. The opening `<h1>` tag should appear first, followed by your content, and then the closing `</h1>` tag.
3. Make sure you placed the header inside the `<body>` tags.
4. Ensure you modified the `index.html` file, and not some other file. 

Let's try again!

### :keyboard: Create a header for your web page

1. Click on the **Code** tab.
1. Click on the `index.html` file.
1. Click the pencil :pencil: to edit the HTML.
1. Inside the body tag, add an opening `<h1>` tag, some content for the header, and a closing `</h1>` tag. 
1. In the _Commit changes_ section, enter a commit message that describes what you've done.
1. Ensure you've selected _Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request_.
1. Give your branch a descriptive name, like `add-headers-and-images`.
1. Click on **Commit changes**.
1. Give your pull request a title, and a comment.
1. Click on **Create pull request.**
