## Step 6: Add a header

Take a peek at your shiny new web page! It can be found at: {{ pagesUrl }}

Headers create prominent text in the body of your web page. Headers come in different levels. For example, a header 1, or h1, is the largest, while a header 3, or h3, is smaller, and a header 6, or h6, smaller still. You can create headers in html using the h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 tags. Here's an example:

```html
<h1>I'm a header 1!</h1>
```

2. Between the body tags, add an opening `<h1>` tag, some content for the header, and a closing `</h1>` tag.
