## Step 2: Open a pull request

GitHub Pages is now serving your web page at: {{ pagesUrl }}

It's not very special looking yet, is it? Web hosts (and GitHub Pages) look for a file titled `index.html` and serve that up. Since there's no `index.html` file in our repository, GitHub Pages displays the contents of the README by default. Let's change this by adding the `index.html` file to our repository.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add `index.html`

To help you get started, I have already created an `index.html` file for you on a branch called: `add-index`. All you need to do is create the pull request. Don't worry, I'll help you!

1. Create a pull request. You can either [use this direct link]({{ repoUrl }}/compare/master...add-index?expand=1), or go to the **Code** tab, click on **New Pull Request**, select **base: master**, and **compare: add-index**.
2. Add a descriptive title to your pull request, something like "Add the index.html file".
3. Add a descriptive body to your pull request.
4. Click **Create pull request**.
