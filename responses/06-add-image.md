## Step 7: Add an image

Fantastico! Headers will help you highlight segments of your web page. 

So far, we've used tags that stand on their own. However, we sometimes need to specify an attribute, which is information that the tag needs to do its work. For example, to display an image, we need an `<img>` tag, but we also need a source attribute so the browser knows the location of the image. We can add an attribute as follows:

```html
<img src="https://octodex.github.com/images/vinyltocat.png">
```

You'll also notice that the image tag doesn't need to close since it is considered to be an [empty](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp) tag.
